# ZAP Web Extension for Automated Vulnerability Remediation

***

### Problem Statement

[cite_start]While the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is effective at identifying security vulnerabilities in web applications, a significant gap exists in the follow-up process[cite: 9, 11]. [cite_start]Users are often left to manually analyze scan results to determine the correct remediation, a process that is inefficient, resource-intensive, and requires considerable time and cost[cite: 12]. [cite_start]This project addresses the lack of a standardized and accessible method to guide users in implementing effective security fixes based on vulnerabilities detected by ZAP[cite: 13].

### Objectives

[cite_start]The primary goal is to develop a ZAP web extension that helps users implement a standardized security improvement system based on ZAP scan reports[cite: 21].

The key objectives are:
* [cite_start]To design and develop a web extension that integrates with ZAP scan outputs (e.g., XML, JSON)[cite: 23].
* [cite_start]To implement functionality for extracting and parsing vulnerability details from ZAP reports[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]To develop a templating system that offers standardized suggestions for security improvements[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]To create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to guide users through the validation process on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge[cite: 26].
* [cite_start]To evaluate the extension by measuring improvements in security, efficiency, and consistency against manual workflow processes[cite: 27].
