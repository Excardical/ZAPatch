# ZAP Vulnerability Remediation Web Extension

A browser extension that integrates with OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) to provide automated vulnerability remediation guidance through templated security fixes.

## üéØ Overview

This web extension addresses a critical gap in cybersecurity tooling: **What to do after vulnerabilities are detected?** While ZAP excels at identifying web application vulnerabilities, users often struggle with implementing effective security fixes. This extension bridges that gap by providing standardized, actionable remediation guidance.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automated Report Parsing**: Extracts and parses vulnerability information from ZAP scan reports (XML/JSON)
- **Template-Based Remediation**: Matches vulnerabilities with standardized security improvement suggestions
- **Educational Guidance**: Provides clear, actionable suggestions for developers and security professionals
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers
- **Customizable Solutions**: Allows customization based on application context
- **Modern UI**: Built with React and Tailwind CSS for an intuitive user experience

## üöÄ Problem Statement

Current penetration testing workflows face significant challenges:
- Manual vulnerability analysis is time-consuming and resource-intensive
- No standardized method for implementing security fixes post-scan
- Limited guidance for organizations with constrained security personnel
- Inconsistent security practices across development teams

This extension transforms the post-scan process by providing:
- Structured security improvement guidance
- Reduced time-to-remediation
- Educational resources for security best practices
- Standardized vulnerability response workflows
